            <h3>A lot of Game Developers have to create NPCs (non playable characters) for their games. Often, each one of these Npcâ€™s needs a name, pre-made dialogue, and a well thought backstory, making the creation of NPCs very boring and tedious for game devs. NpcGenerator uses OpenAI's new large language model (chatGPT 3.5 turbo) to automate this process. Hours of planning simplified to the click of a button.</h3>
